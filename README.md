# Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the "Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science" Specialization, a foundational online program created by DeepLearning.AI and taught by Luis Serrano. This beginner-friendly Specialization is designed to help you master the fundamental mathematical toolkit required for machine learning and data science.

## Overview

As a machine learning engineer or data scientist, a strong grasp of mathematics like algorithms (you can do learn these from Khan Academy's Algorithms course) is essential for understanding the underlying principles behind algorithms and data analysis techniques. This Specialization uses innovative pedagogy and visualizations to help you learn these concepts quickly and intuitively, even if you have a limited background in mathematics.

The recommended prerequisites for this program are:

- At least a high school level understanding of mathematics
- Basic familiarity with Python programming language

Throughout the Specialization, you'll use Python to demonstrate the learning objectives in the environment where they're most applicable to machine learning and data science.
