# # Introduction to the Numpy.linalg sub-library

# In this lab, you will keep developing your skills using Python to solve systems of linear equations by using the sub-libraby [numpy.linalg](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.linalg.html). In this notebook you will:
# 
# - Use `NumPy` linear algebra package to find the solutions to the system of linear equations
# - Evaluate the determinant of the matrix to see again the connection between matrix singularity and the number of solutions of the linear system
# - Explore the numpy.linalg sub-library to get to know its properties

# ### 1.1 - System of Linear Equations
# 
# Here is a **system of linear equations** (or **linear system**) with three equations and three unknown variables:
# 
# 
# $$\begin{cases} 
# 4x_1-3x_2+x_3=-10, \\ 2x_1+x_2+3x_3=0, \\ -x_1+2x_2-5x_3=17, \end{cases}\tag{1}$$
# 
# **To solve** this system of linear equations means to find such values of the variables $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$, that all of its equations are simultaneously satisfied.

# <a name='1.2'></a>
# ### 1.2 - Solving Systems of Linear Equations using Matrices
# 
# Let's prepare to solve the linear system $(1)$ using `NumPy`. $A$ will be a matrix, each row will represent one equation in the system and each column will correspond to the variable $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$. And $b$ is a 1-D array of the free (right side) coefficients:

# In[2]:


A = np.array([
        [4, -3, 1],
        [2, 1, 3],
        [-1, 2, -5]
    ], dtype=np.dtype(float))

b = np.array([-10, 0, 17], dtype=np.dtype(float))

print("Matrix A:")
print(A)
print("\nArray b:")
print(b)


# Check the dimensions of $A$ and $b$ using `shape()` function:

# In[3]:


print(f"Shape of A: {np.shape(A)}")
print(f"Shape of b: {np.shape(b)}")


# Now use `np.linalg.solve(A, b)` function to find the solution of the system $(1)$. The result will be saved in the 1-D array $x$. The elements will correspond to the values of $x_1$, $x_2$ and $x_3$:

# In[4]:


x = np.linalg.solve(A, b)

print(f"Solution: {x}")


# Try to substitute those values of $x_1$, $x_2$ and $x_3$ into the original system of equations to check its consistency.

# <a name='1.3'></a>
# ### 1.3 - Evaluating the Determinant of a Matrix
# 
# Matrix $A$ corresponding to the linear system $(1)$ is a **square matrix** - it has the same number of rows and columns. In the case of a square matrix it is possible to calculate its determinant - a real number that characterizes some properties of the matrix. A linear system containing three equations with three unknown variables will have one solution if and only if the matrix $A$ has a non-zero determinant.
# 
# Let's calculate the determinant using `np.linalg.det(A)` function:

# In[5]:


d = np.linalg.det(A)

print(f"Determinant of matrix A: {d:.2f}")


# Please, note that its value is non-zero, as expected.

# <a name='1.4'></a>
# ### 1.4 - What happens if the system has no unique solution?
# 
# Let's explore what happens if we use `np.linalg.solve` in a system with no unique solution (no solution at all or infinitely many solutions).
# 
# Given another system of linear equations:
# 
# $$\begin{cases} 
# x_1+x_2+x_3=2, \\ x_2-3x_3=1, \\ 2x_1+x_2+5x_3=0, \end{cases}\tag{2}$$
# 
# let's find the determinant of the corresponding matrix.

# In[6]:


A_2= np.array([
        [1, 1, 1],
        [0, 1, -3],
        [2, 1, 5]
    ], dtype=np.dtype(float))

b_2 = np.array([2, 1, 0], dtype=np.dtype(float))

print(np.linalg.solve(A_2, b_2))


# As you can see, it throws a `LinAlgError` because the matrix is singular. You can check it by yourself by computing the determinant of the matrix:

# In[7]:


d_2 = np.linalg.det(A_2)

print(f"Determinant of matrix A_2: {d_2:.2f}")


# The sub-library np.linalg has several linear algebra functions to help linear algebra tasks and we have exhausted so far the functions you have learned in class. 
# 
# Once you learn more theory, the functions in this library will become clearer. You also will be using them in the assignments in week 3 and 4, but do not worry because you will be guided through them.
# 
# Well done! You used the `NumPy` functions to solve a system of equations. As expected, using a predefined function is much easier, but gives much less insight into what is happening under the hood. **This is why the next assignment will be in Gaussian Elimination, a method to solve linear systems**. Remember that `np.linalg.solve` gives an error if there are no or infinitely many solutions, thus when implementing it you will have to think carefully so not to make your program crash!
